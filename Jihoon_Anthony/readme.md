     The purpose of the fear factor visualization is to identify the artist's work(s) who has created the
     emotion fear to the viewer. The visualization allows you to identify artists whose work creates
     the most fear and see the art that they have made. The user is allowed to select one or more
     artists from the bubble chart. That selection will cause the 3 other visualizations to be updated
     accordingly. This includes the list of artists and a picture of their art, a donut chart that breaks
     down their work by style of art, and the bar chart that has a chronological chart of the fear factor
     for those selected artists over time. The project is run by supplying the fear factor dashboard.
     The interaction is done on the dashboard titled which artists have scared us the most.

     We decided to focus on one emotion which is fear, because of how powerful of an emotion it is.
     We first wanted to get rid of artists whose work did not create fear. We created a calculated field
     to filter out feared work. After that we made it so that it would only show fear scores that were
     greater than 0 and implemented this into all of the visualizations. This also included filtering the
     artist into every visualization. For the first visualization We decided to build would show the
     biggest contributors to fear and be able to select them, with the biggest contributors being in the
     middle of the bubble chart and have the largest bubbles. This shows the artist and their fear
     factor score when the user hovers over them. The score is calculated by summing up the
     responses. After we made the bubble chart, we made it so that the other visualizations would
     change based on the artist(s) that were selected. Next we included a visualization that would
     include a list of their art and a url that the user can click on and view. This way the user can
     experience the art by looking at one or more of the works of art by the artist(s) that they have
     selected. We also provided a donut chart that broke down the art by style. We found this to be
     an interesting way to identify what style of art each painting fell into, which most of it seemed to
     fall into modern art. Finally, we created a chart to show when the art was created because there
     is a large span of time when art was created.

     The reason we chose these representations is because we found a way for the user to interact
     with it in a fun way and allows the user to look into the art further. It also provides different levels
     of information from detailed, categorical and quantitative. They are all related together and this
     allows them to tell more information because they build off of one another. We put these
     visualizations together to create an interactive dashboard with the art data.
     For above and beyond, not only did we have more than 2 visualizations, but we had
     representations that went beyond the typical bar chart and and scatterplot. We incorporated
     consistency into our visualizations by using the same data for each one. We integrated imagery
     by being able to click on the image urls in the dashboard.
